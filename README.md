Thunder
=======

Thunder is a C++11 library to provide device-transparent Tensor mathematical operations. We are currently working on a first proof-of-idea version of the library, focusing on applications in [Deep Learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) using high-level parallelization and numerical optimization with GPUs and computer clusters.

Thunder is largely inspired by [Torch 7](http://torch.ch) and Facebook's [TH++](http://github.com/facebook/thpp). In fact, the name "Thunder" came from "TH-under", or "TH--" if "under" could be interpreted as "--".

The library just had its development began. Contribution is very welcomed! Please contact Xiang Zhang (xiang.zhang [at] nyu.edu) for details.
